I'd been trying to become a writer for a long time. A few times I was close, but I alway seemed to talk myself out of it. This was done by me personally or with the *help* of others. 

If you've ever told anyone you want to be a writer, there's a good chance you've been met with something along the lines of "okay, sure, but what are you going to do for money?"

We're a culture that really likes pushing the "starving artist" concept. And look, I know since the very beginning you've probably been told that, but here's the truth people either don't want you to know - or - they're too afraid to admit: it's a myth. It's nothing more than a self-fulfilling prophecy for those who believe it. 

> The truth is, right now, more than any other time in history, is the easiest time to become a writer and do this full-time.

And since we're talking about truths, let's go over another: the competition is **not** what you think it is. As a matter of fact, just **[3%](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-the-percentage-of-peop-pZ2UVJUST_qrAKo1u0xd.Q)** of people who start a novel actually finish. And of that 3%, around 5% go on to publish (both traditionally or self-publish).

So next time you're in a room with 100 writers, remember only 3 of them are walking out with a finished book. Therefore, how do you make sure you're one of them? It's simple and all you have to do is one thing, and one thing only - **FINISH**

However, that's easier said than done, right? I mean, writing a book is hard. It becomes almost impossible when self-doubt kicks in or the thoughts of the outside world seep in through the mental cracks and make you second guess even trying to be a writer in the first place. Oh, and don't even get me started on the people that think it's a time waster. 

Once I finally overcame those things, I realized that having the right mindset made all the different. Thus, my idea to document what the "right" mindset is came into existence. Both to keep me on the path, but also maybe help some others along the way. 

At the time of writing this, I've managed to finish and self-publish (I'll go into why I do this in another post) 7 books. I've written 8 complete novels in total, but 1 didn't make the cut. Additionally, I have a graveyard folder on my computer of an embarrassing high number of unfinished works. 

I hope what follows (my posts) help you and give you the gusto to finish that manuscript. 

I'll leave you with a top before I wrap this up. One that if you take I think will be all you need to succeed: The key to doing this full-time is to approach writing as a craft and a business. Treat it professionally, continually improve your skills, understand your market, and be persistent. Add in having a positive abundance mindset and you can make it happen.
